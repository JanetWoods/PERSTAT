## Welcome to PERSTAT, a flexible Personnel Status Reporting Tool

##### Note: it is no longer deployed on Azure ($$).
##### It was developed in Visual Studio with C#.

#### What makes it flexible?

#### Add People and along with thier status and organizationID. When they are on missions you will be able to quickly and easily see lists based on status, mission, or location.
#### The assignments view shows all personnel currently on assignment.

#### Don't see the status you need?  Add a new status.  Don't see the organization you need?  Add one.

#### Once you have the organization and statuses that you need, use the drop down lists in the add people form so that personnel statistics will be automatically tracked.

#### If a person's status or organization changes, edit that person. Future statistics including that person will reflect the new status and organization.
