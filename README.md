#### What makes it flexible?
# Add People and along with thier status and organizationID. When they are on missions you will be able to quickly and easily see lists based on status, mission, or location.
#### The assignments view show all personnel currently on assignment.

#### Don't see the status you need?  Add a new status.  Don't see the organization you need?  Add one.

#### Once you have the organization and statuses that you need, use the drop down lists in the add people form so that personnel statistics will be automatically tracked.
